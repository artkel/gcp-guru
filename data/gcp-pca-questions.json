Here are the steps to calculate this: 1.Take the number of servers (4) 2.Multiply that number by the number of cores per server (4) 3.Multiply that number by the number of hyper-threads (2) 4 servers x 4 cores per server x 2 hyper-threads = 32 vCPUs",

Dedicated Interconnect enables you to transfer large amounts of data between networks, which can be more cost effective than purchasing additional bandwidth over the public Internet or using VPN tunnels. Benefits: Traffic between your on-premises network and your VPC network doesn't traverse the public Internet. Traffic traverses a dedicated connection with fewer hops, meaning there are less points of failure where traffic might get dropped or disrupted. Your VPC network's internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses are directly accessible from your on-premises network. You don't need to use a NAT device or VPN tunnel to reach internal IP addresses. Currently, you can only reach internal IP addresses over a dedicated connection. To reach Google external IP addresses, you must use a separate connection. You can scale your connection to Google based on your needs. Connection capacity is delivered over one or more 10 Gbps Ethernet connections, with a maximum of eight connections (80 Gbps total per interconnect). The cost of egress traffic from your VPC network to your on-premises network is reduced. A dedicated connection is generally the least expensive method if you have a high-volume of traffic to and from Google's network.",

Folders allow you to group these resources on a per-department basis. Folders are used to group resources that share common IAM policies. While a folder can contain multiple folders or resources, a given folder or resource can have exactly one parent.",

The intent behind both is to prevent people from having higher privilege levels than they actually need Principle of Least Privilege: Users should only have the least amount of privileges required to perform their job and no more. This reduces authorization exploitation by limiting access to resources such as targets, jobs, or monitoring templates for which they are not authorized. Separation of Duties: Beyond limiting user privilege level, you also limit user duties, or the specific jobs they can perform. No user should be given responsibility for more than one related function. This limits the ability of a user to perform a malicious action and then cover up that action.",

Kubernetes Engine's cluster autoscaler automatically resizes clusters based on the demands of the workloads you want to run. C: Solutions like Datastore, BigQuery, AppEngine, etc are truly NoOps. App Engine by default scales the number of instances running up and down to match the load, thus providing consistent performance for your app at all times while minimizing idle instances and thus reducing cost. Note: At a high level, NoOps means that there is no infrastructure to build out and manage during usage of the platform. Typically, the compromise you make with NoOps is that you lose control of the underlying infrastructure.",
