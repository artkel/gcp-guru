The Core Problem: The Frontend Has No Identity

  The fundamental issue is that the "frontend" isn't a single entity with a verifiable identity. The
  frontend is just JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code that gets sent to each user's individual web browser.

   * When you visit the site, the API calls are made directly from your browser on your computer.
   * When another user visits the site, the API calls are made from their browser on their computer.

  From the perspective of your GCP backend, these requests are coming from random IP addresses all over
  the internet. Google Cloud IAM has no way to verify that a request is coming from "your frontend code"
  versus someone else just calling your API directly.

  Because of this, a browser-based frontend cannot use a service account or any other Google Cloud
  identity to make authenticated calls to a private Cloud Run service.

  The Two Standard Architectural Patterns

  This is a classic web architecture problem, and there are two standard solutions:

  1. Public API + User Authentication (The Current Approach)

  This is the most common pattern for modern web apps (SPAs, Next.js, etc.).

   * The backend API is made public (--allow-unauthenticated), meaning anyone can reach the endpoint.
   * Security is handled at the application layer, not the infrastructure layer. You protect your data by
     requiring users to log in. The frontend would get a token (like a JWT) after login and include it in
     the Authorization header of every API call. The backend would then validate this token before
     returning any data.
   * For our current app: Since there is no user login system and the data (the questions) isn't
     sensitive or user-specific, having a public, unauthenticated API is an acceptable and standard
     practice. The security risk is low.

  2. Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Pattern

  This is a more complex but more secure pattern for enterprise-grade systems.

   * The Next.js server itself acts as a proxy.
   * The flow is: User's Browser -> Public Next.js Server -> Private Backend API.
   * In this model, the Next.js server does have a service account. It can be granted IAM permission to
     securely call the private backend. The backend can remain private (--no-allow-unauthenticated).
   * This adds complexity and latency, and it's generally overkill for an application like this.

  Conclusion

  You are right that our backend URL is now accessible to everyone. However, this is the correct and 
  intended architecture for a client-side application that needs to fetch data from an API.

  The security isn't about hiding the backend, but about securing the data within it. If this were an
  application with user accounts and private data, our next step would be to implement a login system
  (e.g., with Firebase Auth or Auth0), not to make the backend private again.

  So, for now, we are on the right path. The deployment that is currently running should be the one that
  finally connects everything correctly.
