### 🚀 **Modern Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python.
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and React 18.
- **State Management**: Zustand with localStorage persistence.
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS.
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Google Cloud Run with cost-optimized scaling.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** 18+ (for frontend)
- **Python** 3.8+ (for backend)
- **Google Gemini API key**

### Local Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/artkel/gcp-guru.git
    cd gcp-guru
    ```

2.  **Set up backend environment**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    # Create .env file in the /backend directory
    echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here" > .env
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Start the application**:
    ```bash
    # From the project root, this starts both backend and frontend concurrently
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000` and automatically proxy API requests to the backend running on `http://localhost:8000`.

5.  **Access the application**:
    - Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project is a monorepo with a separate `backend` and `frontend`.

**Note on `data/gcp-pca-questions.json`**: The version of this file in the public repository is a sample containing only 10 questions for testing and demonstration purposes. The full question set is not included.

## Cloud Deployment

The application is designed for easy deployment on Google Cloud Platform.
- **Backend**: FastAPI on Cloud Run.
- **Frontend**: Next.js on Cloud Run.
- **Storage**: Google Cloud Storage for question data and session history.

The deployed application uses the default URL provided by Cloud Run (e.g., `https://gcp-guru-frontend-....a.run.app`). Custom domain mapping is not used as it is not available in all Cloud Run regions.

- [`documentation/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`](documentation/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) - Complete deployment walkthrough.
- [`deploy.sh`](deploy.sh) - Automated deployment script.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AI features not working:**
1.  Ensure your `.env` file is in the `backend/` directory.
2.  Verify your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is correct.
3.  Restart the backend server after changing the `.env` file.

**Frontend not connecting to backend (local development):**
1.  Ensure both services are running via `npm run dev` from the root directory.
2.  The backend should be on port 8000 and the frontend on 3000.
3.  The Next.js proxy in `next.config.js` handles the connection automatically. There is no need to configure CORS.

**Cold start delays (Cloud deployment):**
1.  The first request after a period of inactivity may take 2-3 seconds. This is normal for a cost-optimized configuration that scales to zero.
2.  Subsequent requests will be fast.
