## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** 18+ (for frontend)
- **Python** 3.8+ (for backend)
- **Google Gemini API key** (for local development)

### Local Installation

The local development setup remains the same and is perfect for feature development and testing.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/artkel/gcp-guru.git
    cd gcp-guru
    ```

2.  **Set up backend environment**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    # Create .env file in the /backend directory for local development
    echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here" > .env
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Start the application**:
    ```bash
    # From the project root, this starts both backend and frontend concurrently
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000` and automatically proxy API requests to the backend running on `http://localhost:8000`.

5.  **Access the application**:
    - Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project is a monorepo with a separate `backend` and `frontend`.

```

```

## Cloud Deployment

The application is deployed on a robust, production-ready GCP architecture.

- **Automated Deployments**: The entire deployment process is automated via a **Cloud Build** CI/CD pipeline. To deploy any changes, simply push your commits to the `main` branch.
- **Infrastructure**: 
  - **Backend**: Private FastAPI service on **Cloud Run**.
  - **Frontend**: Public Next.js service on **Cloud Run**.
  - **Database**: **Firestore** stores all question and user progress data.
  - **Static Files**: **Cloud Storage** hosts the case study markdown files.
  - **Secrets**: The Gemini API key is securely stored in **Secret Manager**.

For a detailed guide on the one-time setup for the cloud environment, see [`documentation/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`](documentation/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).

## Adding New Questions to Production

Once your application is deployed, question data lives in **Firestore**, not in JSON files. To add new questions without overwriting user progress (scores, notes, explanations):

1. **Prepare your new questions file** in JSON format (e.g., `data/new_questions.json`)
2. **Authenticate with Google Cloud:**
   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
3. **Run the migration script:**
   ```bash
   python backend/scripts/add_new_questions.py data/new_questions.json
   ```

The script intelligently:
- ✅ Adds new questions to Firestore
- ✅ Skips existing questions (preserves all user data)
- ✅ Shows a clear summary of added/skipped questions

**To update existing questions** while preserving user progress:
```bash
python backend/scripts/add_new_questions.py data/new_questions.json --overwrite
```

This preserves scores, stars, notes, and AI-generated explanations/hints while updating question text and answers.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AI features not working (local development):**
1.  Ensure your `.env` file is in the `backend/` directory.
2.  Verify your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is correct.
3.  Restart the backend server after changing the `.env` file.

**Frontend not connecting to backend (local development):**
1.  Ensure both services are running via `npm run dev` from the root directory.

**Cold start delays (Cloud deployment):**
1.  The first request after a period of inactivity may take 2-3 seconds. This is normal for a cost-optimized configuration that scales to zero.
2.  Subsequent requests will be fast.
